# task1
This is the repo of task 1 with all screenshot and code work 
I created rest api using java springboot 
A maven project which can make a rest api perform operations of create delete update and search upon server objects . 
Made a database on mongodb and built connections of mongodb and apis using java. All the apis are working properly and have been tested using postman api.
The postman api giving 200 ok as an output when it finds the required server name and when the result is not found it gives 404 error.
In the mongodb database the given collection name is cluster 0 and it stores the inserted server objects .
